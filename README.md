# 🧳 Travel AI Agent

This is a simple AI-powered Travel Assistant project built as part of an IBM learning program. The goal is to create an intelligent virtual agent that can help users plan their trips, suggest destinations, and provide basic travel-related information.

## 📌 Project Scope

- Understand user queries about travel plans
- Recommend destinations based on user preferences
- Provide basic itinerary suggestions
- Display travel details like weather, location, or suggestions using APIs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – For backend logic and scripting
- **Streamlit** – For creating a simple and interactive user interface
- **IBM Watson Assistant** – For understanding and responding to user queries (NLP-based chatbot)
- **IBM Cloud** – Platform to deploy and test AI services
- **IBM SkillsBuild Tools** – Used as part of the IBM learning platform
- **APIs** – (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or travel/location APIs) to fetch live data
- **JSON & REST** – For working with external APIs and data formatting

## 🧪 Output

- A working travel assistant that takes user input like:
  > "Plan a 3-day trip to Goa"  
  > "Suggest places to visit in Japan in winter"

- The assistant responds with:
  - Suggested destinations
  - Itinerary ideas
  - Weather info (if integrated)
  - Simple text-based responses in an interactive interface
